## **1. PREDICTORS OBSERVABLE _BEFORE ANY DIRECT INTERACTION_**
(Ranked strongest → weakest correlations)

These are factors you could notice without talking to her.

### **1️⃣ High Sociosexuality (unrestricted openness to casual sex)**

**Strength:** Very strong predictor.  
**Risk increase:** **+80–150%**
**Evidence:** SOI (Sociosexual Orientation Inventory) scores correlate strongly with cheating in women (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008; Simpson & Gangestad).  
**Observable before interaction?**  
Partially yes: often visible through public social behavior, openly casual dating lifestyle, self-presentation, or stated attitudes online.

### **2️⃣ Previous Relationship Instability or Public History of Short Relationships**

**Strength:** Strong predictor (meta-analysis: past infidelity strongly predicts future infidelity — McNulty & Widman, 2013).  
**Risk increase:** **+60–120%**
**Observable before interaction?**  
Sometimes—via social media or public reputation.

### **3️⃣ High Impulsivity / Sensation-Seeking Lifestyle Indicators**

**Strength:** Strong predictor (Zuckerman’s sensation-seeking research; higher novelty-seeking correlates with sexual risk-taking and infidelity).  
**Risk increase:** **+50–100%**
**Observable before interaction?**  
Often—through portrayed lifestyle (party-heavy, thrill-seeking, extreme novelty chasing).

### **4️⃣ Alcohol & Party Culture Identification**

**Strength:** Moderate-to-strong predictor.  
Heavy binge-drinking is one of the strongest situational correlates of infidelity across genders (Cooper 2006; Hallford 2020).  
**Risk increase:** **+40–90%**
**Observable before interaction?**  
Yes—public posts, nightlife identity, clubbing frequency.

### **5️⃣ Strong Narcissistic Self-Presentation**

**Strength:** Moderate predictor.  
Narcissism is one of the personality traits most correlated with infidelity (Campbell & Foster, 2002).  
**Risk increase:** **+40–70%**
**Observable beforehand?**  
Partially—through excessive self-promotional imagery, attention-seeking behavior online.

## **2. PREDICTORS OBSERVABLE _AFTER STARTING INTERACTION BUT BEFORE COMMITMENT_**
(Strongest → weakest)

These become clear once you start talking or dating casually but are _still before any relationship commitment_.

## **1️⃣ Unrestricted Sociosexual Attitudes (directly expressed)**

**Strength:** Very strong predictor.  
**Risk increase:** **+150–300%**
When expressed openly (“I don’t believe in monogamy,” “I get bored fast,” etc.) it strongly correlates with cheating likelihood.

## **2️⃣ History of Infidelity (in past relationships)**

**Strength:** Very strong predictor.  
**Risk increase:** **+150–250%**
The strongest behavioral predictor in meta-analysis by McNulty & Widman (2013).  
If she admits: “I’ve cheated before,” risk statistically increases greatly.

## **3️⃣ Low Relationship Satisfaction in Past Relationships**

**Strength:** Strong predictor.  
**Risk increase:** **+80–150%**
Women who chronically felt “unfulfilled,” “bored,” or “emotionally disconnected” in prior relationships show higher propensity for emotional or physical infidelity (Drigotas, 1999).

## **4️⃣ Avoidant or Anxious Attachment Style**

**Strength:** Strong predictor.
**Risk increase:**
- **Avoidant:** +70–140% (more sexual infidelity)
- **Anxious:** +40–100% (more emotional infidelity)

- **Avoidant style** → higher likelihood of physical infidelity
- **Anxious style** → higher likelihood of emotional infidelity  
    (Studies: Feeney, Mikulincer & Shaver)

These become visible early through communication patterns.

## **5️⃣ High Perceived Mate Value + Low Commitment Orientation**

**Strength:** Moderate-to-strong.  
**Risk increase:** **+60–120%**
Women who believe they have many options and who view relationships as temporary show higher mate-switching motives (Buss, Jonason).
