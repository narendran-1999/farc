# Risk Assessment Result Categories

This document outlines the risk tiers used in the FARC (Female Adultery Risk Calculator) application. These categories are based on statistical predictors of infidelity found in psychological research, including factors like Sociosexuality, Attachment Style, and Narcissism.

## Risk Tiers

### Minimal Risk (0-19)
**Description:** No major red flags. Her behavior suggests she values commitment, stability, and is not emotionally distant.
**Cautionary Measure:** Proceed normally. Continue building the relationship with standard healthy boundaries.

### Low-Moderate Risk (20-39)
**Description:** A few minor concerns. She might seek attention or validation sometimes, but there are no deep signs of instability or emotional distance.
**Cautionary Measure:** Watch and wait. Don't ignore the small flags. See if they disappear or get worse under stress or if she becomes distant.

### Elevated Risk (40-59)
**Description:** Noticeable red flags. She likely craves constant excitement or admiration, or shows signs of being emotionally distant (avoidant). Research links these to "boredom cheating" or seeking connection elsewhere.
**Cautionary Measure:** Be careful. Do not rush into a serious commitment. Verify she can handle a boring or difficult patch without seeking attention elsewhere or pulling away.

### High Risk (60-79)
**Description:** Strong warning signs. Her profile matches women who have a pattern of unstable relationships, pulling away when things get close (avoidant), or high sexual self-centeredness (narcissism).
**Cautionary Measure:** High chance of history repeating. Past behavior and these traits are strong predictors. Proceed only if you accept high volatility and potential for emotional distance.

### Critical Risk (80-100)
**Description:** Extreme red flags. She has the strongest traits linked to cheating (like a history of unfaithfulness, a strong preference for casual sex, or severe emotional distance/narcissism).
**Cautionary Measure:** Unsafe for commitment. Research shows these traits are part of personality and rarely change. Long-term exclusivity is statistically very unlikely.

## Key Research Concepts

*   **Sociosexuality (SOI):** Orientation towards uncommitted sex. "Unrestricted" SOI is a primary predictor of infidelity.
*   **Avoidant Attachment:** A tendency to be emotionally distant and uncomfortable with closeness, which correlates with infidelity as a way to maintain distance.
*   **Sexual Narcissism:** A sense of sexual entitlement and lack of empathy for a partner's sexual needs.
*   **Relationship Instability:** A history of short, volatile relationships is a strong behavioral predictor of future instability.
